    <h3>3. Writing your first application</h3>
    
    <hr size="1" noshade>

    <p><b>Description of the application</b></p>

    <p>After you finished this part, the finished example application will look
    like this:</p>

    <p><img src="tutorial_02_001.gif" border="0"></p>

    <p>The sample application we are going to use is a simple notebook that has
    only three options. The following options are supported by our notebook:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Showing the list of notes</li>
        <li>Adding a note</li>
        <li>Deleting a note</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Note:</b> In order no to over complicate this example, we will store 
    the notes as files on the disk instead of using a database.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;<br><b>Structuring the application</b></p>

    <p>Before you start writing the actual code, you need to do a little bit of
    planning and determine which actions you will create to make your 
    application work. In our case, we are going to make 3 different actions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>actionDefault:</b> this is the default action and will show the
        list of notes. If no notes are found, it should tell so.</li>
        <li><b>actionAddEntry:</b> this action will take care of adding a new 
        note. It will render the form you need to fill in, but it will also take
        care of handling the form correctly and saving the result to disk.</li>
        <li><b>actionDeleteEntry:</b> this function will delete a note based on
        it's unique ID. In this example, it will not ask you for confirmation, 
        but it will simply delete the note.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now that we know what actions the application will be able to perform, we
    now need to think about how we can store the notes on disk. We will create
    an array for each note which will contain the title, body and the unique ID
    for the entry.</p>

    <p>The unique ID for an entry will be created by calculating the md5
    checksum of the combination of the title and the body. This will ensure that
    each note is unique.</p>
    
    <p>We will use the functions provided by the Yellow Duck Framework to get 
    and save the notes to disk. In the framework, there are different objects
    and functions that take care of this.</p>

    <p>After going through this example, you will have used and explored the
    following classes and modules in the Yellow Duck Framework:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>YDRequest (class)</li>
        <li>YDFSDirectory (class)</li>
        <li>YDForm (class)</li>
        <li>YDObjectUtil (module)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;<br><b>Before we continue</b></p>

    <p>Before we continue, you need to make sure the Yellow Duck Framework is
    properly installed and working correctly. Installation instructions can be
    found in <a href="tutorial_01.html"><i>2. Installing the Yellow Duck 
    Framework</i></a>.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;<br><b>Building the basis of our application</b></p>

    <p>To start, create a new folder in your webroot called "firstapp". We will
    store all the files related to this tutorial in that folder.</p>

    <p>In this folder, we will need to create two files for our application. We
    need 1 file called "index.php", which will contain the actual script that
    drives the application. We will also need a file which is called "index.tpl"
    which contains the template for this application. The template will define
    how the application will be presented in the browser.</p>

    <p>By separating the actual script from the presentation, we will make the
    application a lot easier to maintain and understand. By using this
    structured way, it will be a lot easier to track down problems because you
    know immediately where to look.</p>

    <p>To be continued...</p>
