    <h3>1. Introducing the Yellow Duck Framework</h3>

    <hr size="1" noshade>

    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

    <p>The Yellow Duck framework is web application framework created by
    Pieter Claerhout. More information can be found on
    <a href="http://www.yellowduck.be/">http://www.yellowduck.be/</a>.</p>

    <p>The Yellow Duck Framework takes care of all the difficult work you
    normally have to perform manually when developing a web application. It is
    based on the idea of requests that can perform actions. By encapsulating all
    the programming in an object-oriented environment, you get a framework that
    is easy to use and understand, easy to extend and doesn't limit you in any
    way.</p>

    <p>The Yellow Duck Framework provides you with the following options:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Clean separation of code and output</li>
        <li>Templates for outputting HTML easily</li>
        <li>Automatic action dispatching using URL parameters</li>
        <li>Object oriented form construction and validation</li>
        <li>PEAR based database connectivity which supports all major database
        engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, ...</li>
        <li>Object oriented handling of authentication</li>
        <li>To implement the base functionality, a lot of standard libraries
        were used. Included is a partial copy of the PEAR library from the PHP
        project, which provides things such as database connectivity. More
        information and documentation on the PEAR library can be found on
        <a href="http://pear.php.net/">http://pear.php.net/</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;<br><b>Analyzing the workflow</b></p>

    <p>In the object oriented nature of the Yellow Duck Framework, each script
    that gets executed is based on the YDRequest class. This class is smart
    enough to figure out which functions needs to be called using parameters
    given in the url.</p>

    <p>Let's take a look at an example script to understand how this works:</p>

    
<p><b>Source: sample1.php</b><br>
<pre class="fragment"><span class="comment">// Initialize the Yellow Duck Framework.</span>
require_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/YDFramework2/YDF2_init.php' );

<span class="comment">// Includes.</span>
require_once( 'YDRequest.php' );

<span class="comment">// Class definition for the sample request.</span>
class sample1Request extends YDRequest {

    <span class="comment">// Class constructor</span>
    function sample1Request() {

        <span class="comment">// Initialize the parent class</span>
        $this-&gt;YDRequest();

    }

    <span class="comment">// Default action</span>
    function actionDefault() {
        $this-&gt;setVar( 'title', 'sample1Request::actionDefault' );
        $this-&gt;outputTemplate();
    }

    <span class="comment">// Edit action</span>
    function actionEdit() {
        $this-&gt;setVar( 'title', 'sample1Request::actionEdit' );
        $this-&gt;outputTemplate();
    }

}

<span class="comment">// Process the request</span>
require_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/YDFramework2/YDF2_process.php' );</pre></p>

    <p>The template file that goes along with this script looks as follows:</p>

    
<p><b>Source: sample1.tpl</b><br>
<pre class="fragment">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt?= $title ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt?= $title ?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>When you request the following URL, a number of things happen:</p>

    <pre class="fragment">http://localhost/sample1.php</pre>

    <p>The first line you see in the sample1.php script is the include of the
    file called "YDF2_init.php". This file is responsible for setting up the
    Yellow Duck Framework, and does things such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Defining a number of constants with e.g. the path to specific
        directories and URLs</li>
        <li>Starts or restores the previous session/li>
        <li>Reconfigures the PHP include path</li>
        <li>Includes the different files from the rest of the framework</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After that, we define a new class, called "sample1Request" which is based
    on the YDRequest class. For each script, you need to have 1 class which is
    named as the basename of the file (sample1 in this case) and is appended
    with the string "Request". This class should have the YDRequest class as
    one of it ancestors.</p>

    <p>Since we are inheriting from the YDRequest class, we initialize the
    parent class in the class constructor of the sample1Request class.</p>

    <p>Then we see two functions that start with the text "action". All
    functions that implement actions start with "action". We will see later on
    how you can choose which one gets executed.</p>

    <p>The last part of the script is the include of the "YDF2_process.php"
    script, which processes the actual request. It will look for a request class
    based on the name of the file, and will execute the process function of that
    class. This is where the magic happens.</p>

    <p>The process function checks the URL to see if there was a parameter
    defined with the name "do". This parameter can indicate the action that
    needs to be executed. If the url looked as follows, the function called
    "actionEdit" will be executed.</p>

    <pre class="fragment">http://localhost/sample1.php?do=edit</pre>

    <p>If no action is specified in the url, the default action, called
    "actionDefault" will be executed.</p>

    <p>In both actions, the functions in this script don't do a lot. They will
    set a template variable called "title" and they will output the template to
    the browser. The template contains special tags that are filled in on the
    fly with the right contents.</p>
