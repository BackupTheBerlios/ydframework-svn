<h3> Release History </h3>
<br />
This is the overview of the different releases.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h4> 31 july 2004 - Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 beta 3 (build 483) </h4>
<br />
<ul><li> We are now sponsered by <a href="http://www.redcarpethost.com/index.php?c=9&s30">Red Carpet Host</a>
</li><li> The documentation is now completed.
</li><li> Added options to log debugging info and log messages to a file.
</li><li> Much nicer layout for some of the internal index pages and the index page of the examples.
</li><li> Release history instead of the build logs.
</li><li> Updated phpThumb to version 1.4.6.
</li><li> YDFSDirectory::getContents is able to return custom objects now.
</li><li> Removed the build directory as it was not needed anymore.
</li><li> YDDatabaseDriver_mysql is no longer a separate include file, which increases performance (as most people tend to use <span class="missingpage">MySQL</span><a href="http://www.yellowduck.be/ydf2/wiki/MySQL/edit">?</a> anyway).
</li><li> The API of YDBrowserInfo was updated and it's now part of the YDUtil.php include file.
</li><li> The function enableCache and disableCache were added to the YDTemplate class.
</li><li> The template class is refactored and is no longer automatically instantiated with each request. Also caching is working fine now. An example for caching was added as well.
</li><li> The Smarty Light libraries are updated to 2.2.0.
</li><li> Added conditional HTTP using etags to the YDFeedCreator module (<a href="http://alexandre.alapetite.net/doc-alex/php-http-304/">description</a>)
</li><li> Caching needs to be done with only a cache ID and not a filename (but both should be possible).</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<h4> 18 july 2004 - Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 beta 2 (build 450) </h4>
<br />
<ul><li> Switch from <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a> to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smarty-light/">Smarty Light</a> for the template engine.
</li><li> PHP 5 compatible, but doesn't yet take advantage of the new features.
</li><li> All features from the underlying template engine are now available in the YDTemplate class.
</li><li> Added constant YD_CRLF which contains the end of line appropriate for the current platform. 	</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<h4> 15 july 2004 - Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 beta 1 (build 343) </h4>
<br />
