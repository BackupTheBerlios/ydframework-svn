<h3> Release History </h3>
<br />
This is the overview of the different releases.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h4> Pending for Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 beta 3 </h4>
<br />
<ul><li> [done] We are now sponsered by <a href="http://www.redcarpethost.com/index.php?c=9&s30">Red Carpet Host</a>
</li><li> Complete documentation.
</li><li> [done] Options to log debugging info and log messages to a file.
</li><li> [done] Much nicer layout for some of the internal index pages and the index page of the examples.
</li><li> [done] Release history instead of the build logs.
</li><li> [done] Updated phpThumb to version 1.4.6.
</li><li> [done] YDFSDirectory::getContents is able to return custom objects now.
</li><li> [done] Removed the build directory as it was not needed anymore.
</li><li> [done] YDDatabaseDriver_mysql is no longer a separate include file, which increases performance (as most people tend to use <span class="missingpage">MySQL</span><a href="http://www.yellowduck.be/ydf2/wiki/MySQL/edit">?</a> anyway).
</li><li> [done] The API of YDBrowserInfo was updated and it's now part of the YDUtil.php include file.
</li><li> [done] The function enableCache and disableCache were added to the YDTemplate class.
</li><li> [in progress - docs need update] Template class and caching need rethinking. Currently, they don't really work together. On top of that, we should give the user the option to not automatically instantiate the template object when creating the request (e.g. when the user decides not to use the Smarty Light template engine). What I might come up with is that you need to instantiate the YDTemplate object manually when you instantiate your YDRequest based class. The template directory should also be fixed at that point, making caching a lot easier.
</li><li> The Smarty Light libraries will probably be updated to 2.1.3 (when available).
</li><li> Add conditional HTTP to the YDFeedCreator module (<a href="http://alexandre.alapetite.net/doc-alex/php-http-304/">description</a>)</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<h4> 18 july 2004 - Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 beta 2 (build 450) </h4>
<br />
<ul><li> Switch from <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a> to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smarty-light/">Smarty Light</a> for the template engine.
</li><li> PHP 5 compatible, but doesn't yet take advantage of the new features.
</li><li> All features from the underlying template engine are now available in the YDTemplate class.
</li><li> Added constant YD_CRLF which contains the end of line appropriate for the current platform. 	</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<h4> 15 july 2004 - Yellow Duck Framework 2.0 beta 1 (build 343) </h4>
<br />
<ul><li> First public beta version</li></ul></div>
